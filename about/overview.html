  <h2>About This Course</h2>
  <p>Queuing theory finds its origin in stochastic processes and is widely used in the fields of operations research, probability and statistics. It has a variety of applications ranging from chemical kinetics, dynamic systems to telecommunications, computer systems, wireless networks and financial mathematics. The sole objective of this virtual lab is to develop a software tool which helps the students to understand and visualize the concepts of queues and equip them with the necessary insight so as to apply queuing systems to real world problems.</p>
