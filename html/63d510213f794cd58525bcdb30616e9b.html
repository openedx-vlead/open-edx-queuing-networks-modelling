<p>Q1.What do I need to make use of this website?</p>
<p>Ans:You just need to have a Pc with Broadband internet connection.</p>
<p>Q2.How do I have to make use of this website?</p>
<p>Ans:Basically, the main purpose of this website is to allow you to perform live experiments online. There is a tab on the webpage for Experiments. Clicking it takes you to a list of experiments. Choose an experiment according to your interest. There you will find links to "Live Simulation"</p>
<p>Q3.What are the software or other requirements?</p>
<p>Ans:Flash Player and java is needed.</p>
<p>Q4.Will it work if my internet connection is slow?</p>
<p>Ans:Yes, you may have to wait a little to receive data. The faster your net connection is, the faster you will get data. A broadband connection with 256 kbps is ideal for performing experiment.</p>
<p>Q5.Whom to contact in case I am having any problem with the website?</p>
<p>Ans:There is a "Contact" Tab on the website. Feel free to contact us. Visiting FAQ in query page can also help.</p>
<p>Q6.Can I perform experiment if I am from some different college other than IIT?</p>
<p>Ans:Yes, of course this project is basically aimed for distance learning purpose.</p>
<p>Q7.Can I get some sort of assessment?</p>
<p>Ans:You can compare your result with the typical outputs given on every Live Experiment page. Also, you can always go through quiz (in the Getting Started) designed specifically for this purpose.</p>
<p>Q8.I am getting some absurd values during simulation. I cannot understand the experiment due to this.</p>
<p>Ans: The probable reason is that you are running multiple instances of simulations in that same browser(using multiple tabs or in new window). This is the reason of wrong results. Run only one simulation at a time.</p>
<p>Q9. I've done the experiments a number of times. In some cased I get close to the steady state values in less runs while at times a large number of runs are required to reach the steady state. Why is it so?</p>
<p>Ans: The steady state value and the time required to reach the steady state value depends on the parameters of simulation. For some parameters less runs may be needed while for others the number of runs required may be large.</p>
<p>Q10. Suppose I got utilization 0.73 for run time = 100 whereas theoretical throughput is 0.80. What can I infer from this result. Is it 0.73 same as simulation result with 95% or 99% confidence interval?</p>
<p>Ans: 0.73 means that out of 100 runs 73 times the system has given utilization i.e. the server is utilized 0.73 times . Further if we run this experiment for more runs , the proportion of time server is utilized converges to 0.80.</p>
<p>There is no comparison if our result with simulation result with 95% or 99%.</p>
